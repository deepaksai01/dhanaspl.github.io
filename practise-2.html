        <h1>LIFE = L.I.F.E. + WINING</h1>
        <p>Hi every one.My self BH.D.DARBAR&#40;DHANA&#41; from OOPS team, given a small quotation about the life.I belive the above quotations strongly because, for the first time, when i had seen the line "some times we win, some times we learn", i was gone to think in a logical way that, i defined the meaning of life. In L.I.F.E., i taken intelligence for letter I because one can improves or one can get a strength by practing repeatedly but the intelligence of a one cannot be improved like the strength.one have to get his intelligence naturally from his childhood onwards. so, inorder to win, we have to concentrate on intelligence of a person and then on the strengths.I taken fellings for letter F because feelings of human beings vary from situatin to situation and here feelings of a one person may have strong effect on other person. so, inorder to win, we have to learn the feelings of a one.I taken emotions for letter E because importance of any thing can be learnt from an emotion,i believe. we get emotional, if we lost an important thing.For the next time, we take few precautions, not to miss it again. so,that we have come to know the importance of a thing by an emotion, that we are having on the time of missing. so, learning the importance from an emotion is also helps to win.</p>
